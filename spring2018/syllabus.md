### Description:
This course explores the possibilities and challenges of designing alternate
physical network interfaces. Through weekly readings, class discussions, and a
series of projects, students will create physical objects that talk to each
other over distance. 
Various communication mechanisms such as wired, 
wireless using radio (Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi, and raw), 
and wireless using infrared light are used in the
context of creating novel “smart” devices. 
Topics of discussion in this course
include 
communication protocols;
networking protocols and network topologies; network time versus
physical time; mobile objects; and wireless networks. Opportunities to build
collaborative and creative campus-wide networked projects and systems will
also be explored.

We will also identify existing networked devices and objects and take a
critical look at their implementation from both a technical and social
standpoint.

While there are no pre-requisites for the course, students are encouraged to
have some exposure to programming, electronics, or working with sensors.
Students without these skills will be expected to learn them outside of class.
Supplementary workshops and lessons can be arranged through the professor for
this as needed.

Learning outcomes

At the end of the course, students will be able to :

–  Use microcontrollers and embedded devices to communicate with other machines  
–  describe different network topologies and various uses for them  
–  identify and use a variety of wired and wireless communication protocols  
–  use basic socket communication technologies to share information between machines  
–  build and connect networked objects that can act inside of a larger system, or exist as their own sub-network  

### Evaluation:
Your in-class participation counts towards your grade. This means you are expected to be actively engaged in class discussions, attentive to other students, and mentally present in the classroom and on excursions.

#### Production assignments

There will be several production assignments that involve you building physical prototypes or programming software. You should be prepared to show work on any week a production assignment is due.

#### Online journal

You are expected to keep an online journal for this class. The journal will be
your repository for research, thoughts and reactions to the readings, and a
place for you to comment and critique each other’s work.  Any responses to
readings must be finished 24 hours before class. That is, if we meet on
Wednesday morning, and you have a response due for Wednesday’s class, you must
post it by Tuesday morning. Take the time to read and comment on each other’s
responses, so that we can have a well informed discussion in class.

At minimum, you are expected to have one blog post for every production
assignment documenting the work. If you have multiple posts for one
assignment, tag them appropriately.

The journal must be in your Github repository, either in the README.md or a
different file.

#### In-class participation

You are expected to attend class and actively engage in all discussions, 
exercises, and activities. 
Failure to participate in discussions and demonstrate that the readings 
have been completed will affect the participation component of your grade.
You are expected to pay attention to your peer’s work and presentations in class. 

– Being late 20 minutes or more will count as an absence  
– More than one unexcused absence will result in a lower final grade (a B+ would become a B).   
– More than three unexcused absences will result in failure. If you’re going to be late or absent, email me in advance.  
– If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as possible.  
– If you miss a class session for any reason, you are still responsible for making up the material covered.  
– If you are on your phone or computer, and it is not part of a course assignment, 
you will be given an unexcused absence for the entire day meeting  

#### Midterm project

You will produce a hardware and software production project where you develop
a device that communicates with an online server. The specifics of the project
need to be discussed with the professor in advance.

You will work in pairs on this project.

#### Final Project

You will produce a hardware and software production project where you develop
a fully realized pair (or more) of networked devices. The specifics of the
project need to be discussed with the professor in advance.

You may work in pairs or individually on this project.

#### Class Assignment

Online journal : 20%  
Production assignments : 20%  
Class assignment : 10%  
Participation : 15%  
Final project : 20%  
Midterm project : 15%  

### Required Reading

– Rowland, Goodman, Charlier, Light & Lui. Designing Connected Projects, O’Reilly, 2015.  
– Linked: The New Science Of Networks Science Of Networks, Basic Books, 2014  
– Igoe, Tom. Making Things Talk 2nd Edition. O’Reilly Media/Make, 2011  

Additional readings will be provided as PDFs or online links.

### Methodology

Each class will start with a discussion based on readings, or presentation of
student work. You are expected to always be prepared to show any work you have
done, and come with questions and/or opinions about readings. Generally we
will spend about 30 minutes of each class meeting in this context.

The other half of class will cover new material, often in the form of
technical lectures, design exercises, and in class demonstrations. There will
be at least one or two guest lectures, possibly more depending on speaker
availability.

Please bring a laptop (not a phone or tablet) to class for every meeting
